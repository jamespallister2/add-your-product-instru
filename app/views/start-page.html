        Add your product to the service catalogue
      </h1>

<p>The NHS England digital service catalogue is intended to be a single source of truth about NHS England's national digital services and programmes.</p>
<p>It hosts up-to-date information on digital products to make it easier for internal and external teams to integrate with and use them.</P>
 
<p>Use this guidance to help you:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>add a new product or service to the NHS service catalogue</li>
        <li>update an existing page</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Before you start</h2>

      <p>The service catalogue is for services or programmes that are:</p>
<li>national in scale</li>
<li>owned by NHS England</li>
<li>something to do with digital capability and/or digital transformation</li></p>

<p>To complete this process you will need to have the following:</p>
<li>a good understanding of what your service does</li>
<li>information that allows you to draft a service page</li>
<li>time with the product owner or whomever can say the information is correct</li></p>
